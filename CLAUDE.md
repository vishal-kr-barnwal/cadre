# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cadre is a unified toolkit for **Context-Driven Development** that combines two halves:

- **Spec-first planning** (the Cadre methodology): human-readable context, tracks, TDD workflow
- **Beads**: Dependency-aware task graph, cross-session memory, agent-optimized output

It works with Claude Code (commands + skills) and four other AI coding tools — OpenAI Codex CLI, Cursor, Google Antigravity, and GitHub Copilot — via generated command sets.

> **Generated command sets** (`.codex/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.agent/`,
> `.github/prompts/`) are derived from `.claude/commands/` by
> `scripts/generate-commands.sh`. Edit the canonical Claude command and
> regenerate — do not hand-edit generated files. CI can run
> `bash scripts/generate-commands.sh --check` to detect drift. Ready-made
> drift-gate workflows ship at
> `templates/ci/cadre-monorepo-check.{github,gitlab}.yml` (they run
> `generate-commands.sh --check` + `bash -n` on PRs).

### Commands

All platforms (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Antigravity, Copilot) invoke the same command name.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/cadre-setup` | Initialize project with context files and first track |
| `/cadre-newtrack` | Create feature/bug track with spec and plan |
| `/cadre-implement` | Execute tasks from track's plan (TDD workflow) |
| `/cadre-status` | Display progress overview (`--export` writes a project summary; `--team`/`--mine` filter by assignee; `--repos` shows the polyrepo fleet board; `--regen-index` rebuilds `tracks.md` from `metadata.json.status`) |
| `/cadre-revert` | Git-aware revert of tracks, phases, or tasks |
| `/cadre-validate` | Validate project integrity and fix issues |
| `/cadre-flag` | Flag the current task as blocked or skipped with a reason |
| `/cadre-revise` | Update spec/plan when implementation reveals issues |
| `/cadre-review` | Review a track's diff before shipping (quality gate) |
| `/cadre-ship` | Rebase a reviewed track onto main, push it, prepare the PR (monorepo) |
| `/cadre-land` | Polyrepo: open + link the cross-repo PR group; merge train lands it |
| `/cadre-archive` | Archive completed tracks (local cleanup + learnings) |
| `/cadre-release` | Cut a local release — changelog + version tag |
| `/cadre-handoff` | Create context handoff for section transfer |
| `/cadre-refresh` | Sync context docs with current codebase state |
| `/cadre-formula` | Manage track templates: list, show, create, ephemeral wisp |

### Skills

| Skill | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **cadre** | `.claude/skills/cadre/` | Auto-activates when `cadre/` exists. Provides intent mapping and proactive behaviors. |
| **beads** | `.claude/skills/beads/` | Auto-activates when `.beads/` exists. Provides persistent memory across sessions. |
| **skill-creator** | `.claude/skills/skill-creator/` | Guide for creating new AI agent skills. |

## Key Concepts

### Tracks
A track is a logical unit of work (feature or bug fix). Each track has:
- Unique ID format: `shortname_YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `auth_20241226`). Same-day duplicate IDs get a `-<2char base36>` suffix; on a push/Dolt conflict the track is re-suffixed (dir + `metadata.track_id` + branch + Beads epic/label) and `tracks.md` is rebuilt via `--regen-index`.
- Status markers: `[ ]` new, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` completed, `[!]` blocked, `[-]` skipped
- **`metadata.json.status` is the single source of truth for track status.** `tracks.md` is a derived human-readable cache rebuilt by `/cadre-status --regen-index` — never hand-edit its markers.
- Own directory with spec, plan, metadata, and state files

### Review Gate (New!)
A track must pass review before it ships. `/cadre-review` writes
`metadata.review` (`verdict` ∈ `approved` | `changes_requested`, `blocking_count`,
`date`, `reviewer`) and sets the Beads label `review:ready` or `review:changes`.
`/cadre-ship` and `/cadre-land` then **refuse** to proceed on
`changes_requested` or `blocking_count > 0`; an absent `review` block yields a soft
prompt (warns the track is unreviewed today), and a clean approval proceeds.

### Identity & Leases (New!)
Assignees use the git committer identity (`user.email` → `user.name`), never a
literal `cadre`. `metadata.json` records `owner` and `reviewer`. In **shared**
sync mode a track can hold an advisory `lease` (a no-op in monorepo/local mode);
stale leases are swept by `/cadre-validate`.

### Topology: Monorepo vs Polyrepo (New!)
Cadre runs in one of two topologies, chosen at `/cadre-setup`:
- **Monorepo (default):** no `cadre/repos.json`; all commands behave as they
  always have. Fully backward compatible.
- **Polyrepo:** a `cadre/repos.json` with `mode: "polyrepo"` makes the current
  repo a **control repo** holding `cadre/` + `.beads/` + `.gitmodules`; product
  code lives in **git submodules**. A track spans multiple repos via per-task
  `<!-- repo: <name> -->` annotations; branches/commits/worktrees/reverts are
  per-repo. `/cadre-land` opens one PR per touched repo + a control-repo PR,
  linked by label `cadre-track:<id>`, and a generated **merge train** lands
  them product-repos-first, control-repo-last (order from `metadata.merge_order`).
  The train uses **merge commits with squash disabled as a guardrail** — a squashed
  merge has no deterministic, immediately-available commit to pin the submodule
  gitlink to, so the gitlink pins to the merge commit (`mergeCommit.oid` on GitHub,
  `.merge_commit_sha` on GitLab). PR provider (GitHub/GitLab), sync mode
  (shared/local), and `"auto_open"` (default `false`) live in `cadre/config.json`.
  See [docs/POLYREPO.md](docs/POLYREPO.md).

### Parallel Execution (New!)
Phases can execute tasks in parallel using sub-agents:
- Annotate phases with `<!-- execution: parallel -->`
- Tasks have `<!-- files: ... -->` for exclusive file ownership
- Use `<!-- depends: taskN -->` for task dependencies
- Coordinator spawns workers via Task() tool
- State tracked in `parallel_state.json`

### Task Workflow (TDD)
1. Select task from plan.md (or use `bd ready` if Beads enabled)
2. Mark `[~]` in progress (sync to Beads: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`)
3. Write failing tests (Red)
4. Implement to pass (Green)
5. Refactor
6. Verify >80% coverage
7. Commit with message format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
8. Update plan.md with commit SHA
9. If Beads: `bd done <id> --note "commit: <sha>"`

**Important:** All commits stay local. Cadre never pushes automatically - users decide when to push.

### Beads Integration
When Beads is enabled (`cadre/beads.json` with `enabled: true`):
- Each track becomes a Beads epic
- Tasks sync to Beads for persistent memory
- `bd ready` finds tasks with no blockers
- Notes survive context compaction
- Graceful degradation if `bd` command fails

### Learnings System (Ralph-style)
Cadre captures and consolidates learnings across tracks:

**Per-Track (`learnings.md`):**
- Append-only log of patterns, gotchas, context discovered during implementation
- Each entry includes: timestamp, thread URL, files changed, commit, learnings
- Survives across sessions via handoffs

**Project-Level (`patterns.md`):**
- Consolidated patterns extracted from completed/archived tracks
- Organized by category: Code Conventions, Architecture, Gotchas, Testing, Context
- Read before starting new work to prime context

**Knowledge Flywheel:**
1. Implement → discover patterns
2. Log in track `learnings.md`
3. At phase/track completion → elevate to `patterns.md`
4. Archive → extract remaining patterns
5. New tracks → inherit patterns from `patterns.md`

### Phase Checkpoints
At phase completion:
- Run full test suite
- Manual verification with user
- Create checkpoint commit

## Development Notes

- Canonical commands are Markdown in `.claude/commands/`; the Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, and Copilot sets are generated from them by `scripts/generate-commands.sh`
- Skills use SKILL.md format with references/ subdirectory
- Skills no longer bundle their own command-reference copies — each `SKILL.md` links command names directly to the canonical `.claude/commands/cadre-*.md`
- State is tracked in JSON files (setup_state.json, implement_state.json, metadata.json)
- Git notes used for audit trails
- Commands validate setup before executing
- All supported platforms operate on the same `cadre/` directory structure (interoperable)
